# San Francisco Crime Data Project (Leada challenge I)

This repository contains a small project I completed from [Leada](https://www.teamleada.com). 
The goal was not to model the data but to perform some basic exploratory analysis and answer few questions.

The **appt** folder contains my first Shiny App. Alternatively, I deployed it using shinyapps.io, and you can find it [here](https://jrojas.shinyapps.io/appt/).
